# Vancouver Housing Market Dashboard

## Motivation and Purpose
The city of Vancouver, located on the west coast of Canada, is known for its astonishing natural beauty, vibrant culture, and booming real estate market. The housing market in Vancouver has been one of the most active and competitive in North America in recent years, with prices fluctuating dramatically and demand consistently overshadowing supply. As such, it is crucial for real estate professionals, home buyers, sellers, and even casual spectators to have access to up-to-date information on housing prices and trends.  
  
A dashboard that compiles data on housing prices and presents it in an interactive and informative format can help all stakeholders keep track of the market and make more informed decisions. For example, sellers can use a housing price dashboard to see how their home compares against similar properties in the area, determine an appropriate listing price, and monitor how the market shifts. Buyers, on the other hand, can use a dashboard to compare prices across neighborhoods, track changes in market conditions, and identify the best deals that fit within their budget.  

A housing price dashboard can be useful for more than just buyers and sellers. Researchers and policy-makers can also benefit from such a tool, as it can help them understand the dynamic housing market and make evidence-based decisions. Additionally, members of the public who are curious about the state of the housing market can use a dashboard to gain insights into trends and patterns over time.  

This dashboard aims to provide all these stakeholders with a valuable resource for monitoring the housing market in Vancouver. By compiling data on housing prices from the [City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/property-tax-report/table/?sort=-tax_assessment_year) and presenting it in an interactive and engaging format, we can help users stay informed about the state of the market and make better-informed decisions. The dashboard proposed will be user-friendly and interactive, and will feature a variety of visualizations to help them make sense of the information presented. Ultimately, the goal is to create a comprehensive and informative dashboard that can serve as a valuable tool for anyone interested to know more about Vancouver's housing market.
